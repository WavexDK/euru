# Extra Utilities: ReUtilized

## What is this?
EU:RU is a remake of the popular mod "Extra Utilities 2" from the 1.12.2 days. This mod is not a fork or a mirror, it is a complete rewrite, and does not share any code or textures with the original mod. (WIP, textures need to be done, full release will contain no textures from the original mod)
This mod aims to add intuitive and easy to understand tech, simple magic, building and QOL additions to the game, such as FE machines, new enchantments, new blocks and better storage solutions.
This mod has full compatibility with JEI.

Made with MCreator.

### !! ATTENTION!!

This mod is in HEAVY alpha! The methods of achieving the same functionality as the original mod are very experimental, and can break very easily, if ANY bugs occur please report them to https://github.com/WavexDK/euru/issues/ or join the development discord server below.

## How do I download this mod?

Simple, head to https://github.com/WavexDK/euru/releases and click on the top result, then download the `.jar` file below the changelog.

If you're in singleplayer, simply drag and drop the file into your `.minecraft/mods` folder, and restart your game.

If you're on a server, do the above steps for all users and drag and drop the file into your `/mods/` folder on your server and restart the server.

After this, everything should most likely work.
